## Project Overview

![input schema](nyc_taxi\assets\NYC-TLC-ERD.png)

Welcome to the NYC Taxi Data Warehouse - a comprehensive analytics platform built on NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) trip record data. This data warehouse provides clean, validated, and analysis-ready datasets for understanding taxi operations, passenger behavior, and urban mobility patterns across New York City.

## ðŸš– Data Sources

### Yellow Taxi Data
**Coverage:** All five boroughs, with primary service in Manhattan and airports  
**Service Period:** 2020 - Present  
**Volume:** ~200M+ trips annually  
**Special Features:** Airport fees, higher service density in Manhattan

### Green Taxi Data  
**Coverage:** Outer boroughs and upper Manhattan (north of 96th St E/110th St W)  
**Service Period:** 2020 - Present  
**Volume:** ~20M+ trips annually  
**Special Features:** Designed to serve underserved areas

## Data Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Raw TLC Data â†’ Data Quality Filters â†’ Calculated Metrics â†’ Analytics-Ready Tables
```

### Data Quality Standards
- **Completeness:** Remove records with missing critical fields
- **Validity:** Filter unrealistic distances, speeds, and fare amounts  
- **Consistency:** Validate fare component calculations
- **Timeliness:** Exclude future-dated records
- **Accuracy:** Apply business rule validations

### Quality Filters Applied
- Trip distance: 0-100 miles
- Trip duration: 1 minute - 8 hours  
- Speed: 1-80 mph (when calculable)
- Passenger count: 1-8 passengers
- Fare per mile: $0.50-$20.00
